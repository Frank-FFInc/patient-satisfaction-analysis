# Patient Healthcare Satisfaction ETL

## Overview
For this exercise, I have selected the Healthcare Patient Satisfaction Dataset from 2020

Size: 256.97 MB

This dataset was selected under the assumption that this would relate to data I work with in the future if I am selected for the Machine Learning role. In addition, I see this as an opportunity to score brownie points :)


## Setup
Go to this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggleprollc/healthcare-patient-satisfaction-data-collection

Select the last csv file: cms_hospital_patient_satisfaction_2020.csv

Download the file and save it to a relevent directory ex. /patient_satisfaction/data

## With Open Terminal
git clone <repo>
pip install -r requirements.txt

-For the etl.py script, make sure CSV is set to the right directory

Run with the "python etl.py" command
